# Bank-Marketing-Analysis
This dataset refers to the problem of telemarketing for a bank. The dataset is collected from
a Portuguese bank. The bank wants to have an effective telemarketing strategy to sell
long-term deposit accounts (e.g., bonds, saving accounts, etc.). These marketing
campaigns were based on phone calls and multiple contacts were often needed to
determine whether a customer would subscribe to a long-term deposit account. Analysis will help this bank in determining these customers and devising an effective
telemarketing strategy by applying data analytics method on the given dataset.
